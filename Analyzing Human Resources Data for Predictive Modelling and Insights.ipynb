        "# Introduction\n",
        "In this project, we aim to investigate the potential statistical significance of interaction effects observed between \"Age\" and \"EducationField\" in predicting the \"MonthlyIncome\" of employees through a multiple linear regression model. We will also consider the effects from Total Working Years, Department,\n",
        "and Job level in out analysis. This question interests us as students about to enter the workfoce. It also coincides with questions such as those asked by Statisitcs Canada, as to weather or not it is beneficail for an older worker to go back to school, as found in this artilce. This study's significance stems\n",
        "from the practical implications it could have for human resource management and organizational development. The dataset utilized comprises information on 1,470 employees, encompassing 35 distinct attributes. For this analysis, we have selected the following key variables:\n",
        "* Age (Continuous): This represents the age of the employee, which could play a pivotal role in determining their experience level, career progression, and consequently, their monthly income.\n",
        "* JobLevel (Categorical): This variable indicates the level of the job within the company hierarchy, categorized from 1 to 5. Job level can be a reflection of an employee's seniority, responsibilities, and earning potential.\n",
        "* TotalWorkingYears (Continuous): This denotes the total number of years an employee has been working. It serves as an indicator of an individual's professional experience, which can directly influence their earning capacity.\n",
        "* Department (Categorical): The department to which an employee belongs can have implications on their role, specialization, and consequently, their monthly income. The dataset includes departments like Sales, Research & Development, and Human Resources among others.\n",
        "* EducationField (Categorical): This variable specifies the field of education pursued by the employee, such as Life Sciences, Medical, Marketing, Technical Degree, Human Resources, or Other. Education can significantly impact an individual's skill set, qualifications, and career trajectory, thereby affecting their earning potential.\n",
        "\n",
        "By examining these selected variables, which encompass both continuous and categorical data, we aim to gain insights into the factors influencing employee monthly income and discern any significant interaction effects between age and education field. We are particuraly intersted in the relation between\n",
        "Monthly Income and Age. An atricle from bloomberg.com claims that pay for older worker has increased by 69% in recent years, yet there is still a gap in pay bewtween the age groups. We are curious to see if we can find a similar result.\n",
        "This investigation holds substantial relevance for human resource strategies and organizational planning, potentially guiding decisions related to employee compensation, career development, and talent management."
